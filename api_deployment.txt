Deploying a FastAPI application to Heroku on a Windows system involves the same general steps as on other operating systems, but there are some specifics you should be aware of. Below is a step-by-step guide tailored for Windows users.
1. Set Up Your FastAPI Application
a. Create a Project Directory

    Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

    Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

    sh

    mkdir my_fastapi_app
    cd my_fastapi_app

b. Create Your FastAPI Application File

    Use a text editor (e.g., Notepad++) or an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to create a file named main.py in your project directory.

    Add the following code to main.py:

    python

    # main.py
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    def read_root():
        return {"Hello": "World"}

c. Create requirements.txt

    Install dependencies locally:

    sh

pip install fastapi uvicorn gunicorn

Generate a requirements.txt file:

sh

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

d. Create Procfile

    Create a file named Procfile (no extension) in your project directory.

    Add the following line to Procfile:

    txt

    web: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app

        Ensure that Procfile has no file extension and is correctly named.

2. Prepare for Deployment
a. Install Git

    Download and install Git for Windows from git-scm.com.

    During installation, choose the option to add Git to your system path.

b. Initialize Git Repository

    In Command Prompt or PowerShell, initialize Git:

    sh

git init

Add and commit your files:

sh

    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit with FastAPI app and Procfile"

3. Install and Configure Heroku CLI
a. Install Heroku CLI

    Download and install the Heroku CLI for Windows from Heroku CLI installation page.

    After installation, restart Command Prompt or PowerShell to ensure the CLI is available.

b. Log In to Heroku

    Log in to your Heroku account:

    sh

    heroku login

    A browser window will open asking you to log in. Follow the instructions to authenticate.

4. Deploy Your FastAPI Application to Heroku
a. Create a New Heroku Application

    Create a new Heroku app:

    sh

    heroku create your-app-name

        Replace your-app-name with a unique name for your Heroku app. If you don't specify a name, Heroku will generate a random name for you.

b. Deploy Your Code

    Push your code to Heroku:

    sh

    git push heroku master

        If your branch is named main, use git push heroku main.

c. Open Your Application

    Open your deployed app in a web browser:

    sh

    heroku open

5. Manage and Scale Your Application
a. Scale Dynos

    Scale your dynos as needed (by default, Heroku runs one web dyno):

    sh

    heroku ps:scale web=1

b. View Logs

    Monitor logs for any issues:

    sh

    heroku logs --tail

c. Set Environment Variables

    Set environment variables if needed:

    sh

    heroku config:set KEY=VALUE

        Replace KEY and VALUE with your environment variable names and values.

d. Add Add-ons

    If you need additional services (e.g., databases), add them using:

    sh

    heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev

        You can find more add-ons in the Heroku Add-ons Marketplace.

Example Summary

Project Structure:

css

my_fastapi_app/
│
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── Procfile

main.py:

python

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

requirements.txt:

makefile

fastapi==0.95.2
uvicorn==0.22.0
gunicorn==20.2.0

Procfile:

makefile

web: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app

Deployment Commands:

sh

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
heroku login
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku master
heroku open

Troubleshooting

    Deployment Issues: Check logs with heroku logs --tail for error messages.
    Application Not Starting: Verify that Procfile is correctly named and formatted.
    Environment Variables: Ensure all necessary environment variables are set.
